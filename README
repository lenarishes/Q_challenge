Task:
Given a 7 digit telephone number, 
print out all the possible combination of letters 
that can represent the given telephone number. 
Note that in a standard 12 key pad, 0 and 1 do not have any letters 
associated with them. They are to be treated as such 
i.e. a 0/1 in the telephone number will be retained as such in the 
final word as well.
